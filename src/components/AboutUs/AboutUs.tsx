              As a father, Mark discovered that the most profound teaching moments came not from instruction, but from connection. Through bedtime stories and daily conversations with his own children, he witnessed how gentle guidance and emotional understanding could shape young minds.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
              This revelation inspired the Building Blocks of Bravery seriesâ€”a collection of stories that help children navigate life's challenges with confidence and compassion. Each book is crafted to spark meaningful conversations between parents and children, fostering emotional intelligence and resilience.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
              Mark's journey into self-publishing emerged from his desire to share these valuable lessons with families worldwide, proving that the most impactful stories come from the heart.
